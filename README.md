💡 What Is Flash USDT?
Flash USDT is a synthetic transaction method that simulates the transfer of Tether (USDT) into a wallet. These transactions appear instantly in wallet balances — without ever being confirmed on the blockchain — and disappear after a short time or block interval.

Think of it as a temporary, visual representation of USDT that looks real in a wallet but vanishes after expiry.
